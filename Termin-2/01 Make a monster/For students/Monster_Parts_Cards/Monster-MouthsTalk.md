## Activity Checklist { .check}

+ To make your monster talk, you can just use the
	 `Say`{.blockpurple} sprite.
```blocks
when [space v] key pressed
say [Hello!] for (2) secs
```
+	 To make it a bit more impressive, you could
	 make the monsters **mouth open** and **close**
	 whilst it is talking. To do this, edit the sprite
	 that contains the mouth - create a new
	 `costume`{.blockpurple} that has a closed mouth.
	 By switching between the two, you can animate
	 the mouth opening and closing.
```blocks
repeat (8)
	wait (0.1) secs
	switch to costume [mouthClosed v]
	wait (0.1) secs
	switch to costume [mouthOpen v]
end
```
+ To hook the two up, have the block that does the `say`{.blockpurple} broadcast a message that the other block can react to.

```blocks
when [space v] key pressed
broadcast [talk v]
say [Hello!] for (2) secs

when I receive [talk v]
repeat (8)
	wait (0.1) secs
	switch to costume [mouthClosed v]
	wait (0.1) secs
	switch to costume [mouthOpen v]
end
```

+	 To make this a bit more flexible, use a
	 variable to control the `talkTime`{.blockorange} the monster
	 says something for, and also to control
	 how many times the animation loop is
	repeated.

```blocks
when [space v] key pressed
set [talkTime v] to (2)
broadcast [talk v ]
say [Hello!] for (talkTime) secs

when [a v] key pressed
set [talkTime v] to (4)
broadcast [talk v]
say [Something a bit longer] for (talkTime) secs

when I receive [talk v]
repeat ((talkTime) * (4))
	wait (0.1) secs
	switch to costume [mouthClosed v]
	wait (0.1) secs
	switch to costume [mouthOpen v]
end
```
**(Notice how we multiply talkTime by 4 to
make sure the loop repeats enough
times?)**

+ You can also make your monster speak using
	 sound by using one of the sound blocks. Just be
	 sure to import the sounds first in the sounds tab.

```blocks
when I receive [talking v]
play sound [Screech v]
```
**Why not try adding sounds to other events, you could use a spooky hovering
sound for a ghost drifting around the screen! If you have a microphone on
your computer you can even record your own sounds, surprise your classmates
by recording a loud monster ROOOAAAAARRRRR!!!**
