+ You can give your monster eyes that follow your mouse pointer all over the screen. Your monster can have as many eyes as you like, even eight like a spider! Because we always want our monster eyes to follow our mouse pointer we need to use the `forever`{.blockyellow} block. Once **green flag** scripts have started we `forever`{.blockyellow} want our eyes to point in the direction of the mouse and re-adjust every fraction of a second. 

```blocks
when FLAG clicked
forever
	point towards [mouse pointer v]
	wait (0.2) secs

when I receive [moved right v]
change x by (move speed)

when I receive [moved left v]
change x by ((move speed) * (-1))
```

**Notice we also use broadcast to move our eyes along with our body and other parts. What else can you make the eyes do? If you move your mouse cursor between your monsterâ€™s eyes, it will go cross eyed!**
