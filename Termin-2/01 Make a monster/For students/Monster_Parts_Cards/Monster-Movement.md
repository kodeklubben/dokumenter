## Activity Checklist { .check}

+ As your monster will be made up of lots of **sprites** you will need to make sure that
	 all sprites move together at once. Rather than adding move commands to all your
	 sprites you can simply attach your controls to your body sprite and use `broadcast`{.blockbrown}
	 to control any other sprite.
	 When our **Tentacle sprite**
	 (or any other sprite for that
	 matter!) receives a
	 `moved right`{.blockbrown} broadcast,
	 we can move it to the right
	too.

```blocks
// on Ghost Body
when [right arrow v] key pressed
change x by (moveSpeed)
broadcast [moved right v]

when [left arrow v] key pressed
change x by ((moveSpeed) * (-1))
broadcast [moved left v]
```

```blocks
// on Tentacle

when I receive [moved right v]
change x by (moveSpeed)

when I receive [moved left v]
change x by ((moveSpeed) * (-1))
```

+ Using `broadcast`{.blockbrown} also means if we want to change the way our movement
	 commands work, we only have to change one set of
	scripts. **Have a look at this example:**

```blocks
// on Ghost Body
when [right arrow v] key pressed
change x by (moveSpeed)
point in direction (90 v)
if on edge, bounce
if (not (touching [edge v]?))
	broadcast [moved right v]
	broadcast [moved v]
end

when [left arrow v] key pressed
change x by ((moveSpeed) * (-1))
point in direction (-90 v)
if on edge, bounce
if (not (touching [edge v]?))
	broadcast [moved left v]
	broadcast [moved v]
end
```

+ Here we’re telling the body to face the direction it
	 is moving (make sure your sprite orientation is set
	to **“only face left-right”**) and to stop and turn around
	 if it collides with the edge of our screen. You will have
	 also noticed that we have wrapped our broadcast
	 in an `if`{.blockyellow} block, we only want the other body parts
	 to move if the body isn’t on the edge of the screen.
	 **If you decide to add any animation to the
	 movement, make sure that any associated
	 movements take just as long. i.e. if moving a leg
	 to the left takes 1 second due to an animation, all
	 other left movements must take 1 second too
	 (use a `wait`{.blockyellow} block to make sure they’re all in step).**

+ You can also animate your body sprite using
	 `costume`{.blockpurple} changes, by triggering the change every
	 time a movement broadcast is received.

```blocks
when I receive [moved right v]
next costume
```
