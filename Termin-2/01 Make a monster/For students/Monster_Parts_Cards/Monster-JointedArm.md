+ A jointed arm is made from **two sprites**, they can be quite tricky to build as the
two parts of the arm need to know where each other are in order not to separate
and look strange. This is done using a mathematical calculation called
**trigonometry** that is regularly used in the production of video games, robots and
other cool technology. **Our first arms sprite is the upper arm**, this is not too tricky,
as it will simply rotate at the shoulder and
move along with the body and all our other
body parts. One thing we will need to add
however is setting our arm `direction`{.blockblue} to
variable (more on this later).
```blocks
when [space v] key pressed
turn cw (15) degrees
set [left arm v] to (direction)
broadcast [moved v]
change x by (move speed)
```
+ This next calculation is used to control the
	 **lower arm**. This is where we use trigonometry to calculate where the lower arm
	 should be place (you might need to ask for help when doing this).
```blocks
when I receive [moved v]
go to [Sprite3 v]
go to x: ((x position) + ((45) * ([sin v] of (left arm)))) y: ((y position) + ((45) * ([cos v] of (left arm))))
```
+ First of all our arm will update when the broadcast `moved`{.blockbrown} is used but you can
	 use any broadcast as long as your upper arm is broadcasting it or moving to
	 the same broadcast as your lower arm.
+	 Next our lower arm positions itself at the **center point** of the upper arm, this
	 should be the point where the top of the upper arm meets the shoulder body.
	 We then want to reposition the lower arm elbow to the other end of the upper
	 arm. Imagine that as the upper arm rotates around the shoulder we draw a
	 circle, first of all what is the radius of that circle? Well our arm in this example is
	about **45 pixels** long.
	 We then want to find out what point around that circle the other end of our arm
	 is, and position our lower arm there. We use the trigonometry calculation above to
	 reposition our lower arm and create an elbow.
