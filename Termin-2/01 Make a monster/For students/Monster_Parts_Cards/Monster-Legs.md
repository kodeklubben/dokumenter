+ Using two **legs sprites** we can make our monsters
	 appear to walk. To do this we need to set up a
	 **variable** that switches between two states, one for
	 our leg swinging forward and another for
	 backwards (we’ll reverse these states for the other
	 leg). To do this we need to first set up a `step`{.blockorange}
	 variable, then every time our moving broadcast is
	received, **increase the variable by one**. If the
	 variable goes higher than one (we can test this
	 with the greater than operator `>`{.blockgreen}) we reset it back
	to **zero**.

```blocks
when FLAG clicked
set [move speed v] to [5]
set [step v] to [0]

when I receive [moved left v]
change [step v] by [1]
if < (step) > [1] >
	set [step v] to [0]
end

when I receive [moved right v]
change [step v] by [1]
if < (step) > [1] >
	set [step v] to [0]
end
```

+	 Now we can set our legs to swing by checking
	 against our `step`{.blockorange} variable. **When the variable
	 is set to zero** we can change the direction of
	 our leg (here we’ve used a fixed `direction`{.blockblue} to
	 stop our legs going mad if our variable and
	 angle don’t match up, but maybe you want
	 your monster to do that!). Don’t forget to move
	 you legs along with your body using your
	 `move speed`{.blockorange} variable.

```blocks
when I receive [moved right v]
change x by (move speed)
if < (step) = [0] >
	point in direction (180 v)
else
	point in direction (165 v)
end

when I receive [moved left v]
change x by ((move speed) * [-1])
if < (step) = [1] >
	point in direction (165 v)
else
	point in direction (180 v)
end
```

**You could use the same sort of actions to make
simple waving arms or even flapping bird wings.**
