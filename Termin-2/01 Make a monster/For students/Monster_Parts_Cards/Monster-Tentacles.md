+ To make a tentacle wiggle, we could **rotate** it and **resize** it by a `random`{.blockgreen} small
	 amount using a variable, and then
	 wait a short period before reverting
	back.

```blocks
set [tentacleRotation v] to (pick random (1) to (10))
set [tentacleSize v] to (pick random (1) to (10))
change size by (tentacleSize)
turn ccw (tentacleRotation) degrees
wait (0.5) secs
change size by ((tentacleSize) * (-1))
turn cw (tentacleRotation) degrees
```

**(Notice how we multiply the tentacleSize by -1 to get the negative value?)**
