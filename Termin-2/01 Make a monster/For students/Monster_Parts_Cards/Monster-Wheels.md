+ To make a wheel appear to move, we want to **rotate** it by a small amount and
	 move it by a small amount when
	 we receive a **movement broadcast**.

```blocks
when I receive [moved left v]
change x by ((move speed) * (-1))
turn ccw (15) degrees

when I receive [moved right v]
change x by (move speed)
turn cw (15) degrees
```

+	 If you wanted, you could replace the
	 values with variables like `move speed`{.blockorange}, so you could control the speed in all
	 directions from one place.

**(Notice how we have to multiply moveSpeed by -1 to get the negative value?)**
