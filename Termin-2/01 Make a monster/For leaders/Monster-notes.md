#NOTES FOR CLUB LEADERS
##Design & animate your own monster (level 4)

__Introduction:__
In this project your students will design and animate their very own monster! They’ll need to plan what their monster looks like, how they move, where they live and if they make any sounds.

##Project plan
This project should take 3-4 weeks to complete

* __Week 1:__ Planning what the monster looks like. You’ll need plenty of plain paper, colouring pencils and felt tips etc so the students can design their monster.
* __Week 2:__ Create the parts of the monster in Scratch using the paint tool 
* __Week 3-4:__ Animate the parts of the monster using the cards provided. There are cards for each part of a monster but the children can make up anything they like.

##Resources
The children will be designing their own monster parts and can use sounds from the Scratch resources if no sound recording equipment is available at your school. Print one monster planning sheet per child and one set of monster parts cards can be shared between 2/3 children.

##Monster part cards to be printed:

* Legs
* Jointed arm 
* Mouths and talking 
* Eyes
* Wheels 
* Movement 
* Tentacles
