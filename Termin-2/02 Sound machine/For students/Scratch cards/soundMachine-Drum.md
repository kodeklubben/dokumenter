## Activity Checklist { .check}

+ Import a new sprite and choose Things -> Drum. Name the sprite “Drum”.

+ We want the drum to make a sound when we click it or press the 
  `space`{.blockbrown} key.
```blocks
when Drum clicked
broadcast [drum v]

when [space v] key pressed
broadcast [drum v]
```

+ Now we need to make a sound when it receives `drum`{.blockbrown}. You can 
  change the number if you want to change the sound the drum makes.
```blocks
when I receive [drum v]
play drum (48 v) for (0.2) beats
```

+ Try changing the appearance to make it obvious which instrument was played.
```blocks
when I receive [drum v]
play drum (48 v) for (0.2) beats
set size to (110) %
wait (0.1) secs
set size to (100) %
```
