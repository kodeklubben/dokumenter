+ Create a new sprite and make it resemble the sound you will be making.

+ In the `sounds`{.blocklightgrey} tab, create a new recording or import a sound.
  ![cat sound sample](sound-sample.png)

+ When the sprite is clicked, `broadcast`{.blockbrown} the same name as your 
  sprite.
```blocks
when Cat clicked
broadcast [cat v]
```
+ Now we need to play the `sound`{.blockpurple} when it receives the 
  `broadcast`{.blockbrown}.
```blocks
when I receive [cat v]
play sound [cat v]
```

+ Finally, make the sprite change in appearance when the `sound`.{blockpurple} 
  is played.
```blocks
when I receive [cat v]
play sound [cat v]
set size to (110) %
wait (0.1) secs
set size to (100) %
```
