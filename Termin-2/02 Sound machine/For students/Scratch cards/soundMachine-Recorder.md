## Activity Checklist { .check}

+ Create two new lists (for all sprites). Call one of them 
  `instrument`{.blockred} and the other `timing`{.blockred}.

+ Create a new variable (for all sprites) called `recording`{.blockorange}

+ For each of your instruments (drum, piano, each sound sample etc.), you will 
  need to add the following items to the `when I receive`{.blockbrown} block. 
```blocks
if <(recording) = (1)>
  add (timer) to [timing v]
  add (cat) to [instrument v]
```
  Change the word “cat” in `add [cat] to [instrument v]`{.blockred} to match 
  the name of the message used to play this sound.
```blocks
when I receive [drum v]
play drum (48 v) for (0.2) beats
if <(recording) = (1)>
  add (timer) to [timing v]
  add (cat) to [instrument v]
end
set size to (110) %
wait (0.1) secs
set size to (100) %
```

+ Draw a new sprite and give it a red circle costume. Name this sprite “Record”.
  ![record costume](record-costume.png)

+ Create a script that sets `recording`{.blockorange} to 1 and deletes all of 
  `instrument`{.blockred} and `timing`{.blockred} when clicked. 

## Test your project {.flag}
  Try clicking the record button. What happens when you play instruments?

+ Create another sprite and give it a costume in the shape of a green arrow. 
  Call this “Play”.
  ![play costume](play-costume.png)

+ Create a new variable called `index`{.blockorange} for Play only.

+ Now we need to make the playback actually do something. Add this script to 
  "Play"
```
when Play clicked
set [recording v] to (0)
set [index v] to (1)
reset timer
forever
  if <(item (index) of [timing v]) < (timer)>
    broadcast (item (index) of [instrument v])
    change [index v] by (1)
    if <(index) > (length of [timing v])>
      stop script
    end
  end
end
```
